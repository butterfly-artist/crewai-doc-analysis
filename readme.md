You are building a Document Summarizer Crew using CrewAI.
The crew will collaborate to process any long document (a PDF or article), split it up, summarize each section, and produce a compact summary for quick reading.

The workflow includes:

Collector Agent: Loads and preprocesses the full document.

Splitter Agent: Divides the document into logical sections or paragraphs.

Summarizer Agent: Summarizes individual sections, focusing on clarity and conciseness.

Digest Compiler Agent: Collects all section summaries and compiles a single digest, reviewing for coherence and readability.

The final output is a markdown file with:

A one-paragraph executive summary.

Bulleted summaries for each document section.

Any key insights or takeaways highlighted at the end.

Instructions:

Agents should communicate results and context to the next agent in the workflow.

Summaries must be original, brief, and easy for a layperson to read.

Compiler Agent should ensure the digest is well formatted (headings, bullets).

Optional Enhancements:
If youâ€™re dealing with PDFs, the Collector Agent should use a PDF parser to extract text.
For especially long documents, allow the Splitter Agent to set word or section limits.
Enable the Summarizer Agent to note any unclear sections or missing information.
